        As a full stack developer, I specialize in creating user-friendly
        interfaces that are visually appealing and intuitive. My expertise
        includes React, JavaScript, and various libraries and APIs. When I code
        on my free time, I like to make complex games such as Durak or the
        simple favorites like tic tac toe. Check out some of my work!
