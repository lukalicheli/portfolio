        I specialize in creating user-friendly interfaces that are visually
        appealing and intuitive. My expertise includes React, JavaScript, and
        various libraries and APIs. When I code on my free time, I like to make
        complex games such as Durak or the simple favorites like tic tac toe.
        Check out some of my work!
